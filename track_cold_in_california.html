            <h2>Cold In California</h2>

            <p>

                [Verse 1] <br>
                Just out of reach is the gold you're rushing for <br>
                With bags under your eyes <br>
                I've been chasing a rainbow, wound up at your door <br>
                Wanna see the other side <br><br>

                [Pre-Chorus]<br>
                It's not quite like I imagined, like I did before <br>
                When you're pouring all your heart out <br>
                But you're lying on the floor <br>
                All the cigarettes and hotels <br>
                Could be what you're looking for <br>
                But it's not what you expected <br>
                And you're left wanting more <br><br>

                [Chorus] <br>
                Don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br>
                See, everybody thinks they know ya <br>
                They're only seeing what they wanna <br>
                Oh, don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br>

                [Verse 2] <br>
                We can dance in the streets <br>
                With the sun upon our skin <br>
                And wake up feeling burned <br>
                Under stars, we can freeze <br>
                'Cause we've gotten used to heat <br>
                Where seasons never turn <br><br>

                [Pre-Chorus] <br>
                It's not quite like I imagined, like I did before <br>
                When you're pouring all your heart out <br>
                But you're lying on the floor <br>
                All the cigarettes and hotels <br>
                Could be what you're looking for <br>
                But it's not what you expected <br>
                And you're left wanting more <br><br>

                [Chorus] <br>
                Don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br>
                See, everybody thinks they know ya <br>
                They're only seeing what they wanna <br>
                Oh, don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br><br>

                [Bridge] <br>
                Talk about the pretty parts, the ones you see on film <br>
                Happiness and skinny legs and living on a hill <br>
                Don't talk about the ugly parts, the loneliness you feel <br>
                You probably always will <br><br>

                [Chorus] <br>
                'Cause it gets dark in California <br>
                I know it well, better than most, yeah <br>
                Don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br>
                See, everybody thinks they know ya <br>
                They're only seeing what they wanna <br>
                Oh, don't mind what anybody told ya <br>
                It still gets cold in California <br><br>
